## What

A version of the [YOLO architecture (versions 1 through 3)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), optimized for malaria detection on the ULC-Malaria-Scope.

## Why

- Need to count the number of malarial vs. healthy red blood cells in a patient sample with high accuracy
- Need to count at (almost) real-time (around 30 FPS) on restrictive hardware (Raspberry Pi 4 + Intel Neural Compute Stick 2)
- Existing YOLOv\* models run very slowly on the Pi (300 ms+ inference, or about 3 FPS)

## Results

- Initial benchmark of this model was run at ~40 FPS on the Raspberry Pi 4 w/ NCS2

## Dataset definition

To define the dataset, we use a `.yml` file.

### `description.yml` requirements

The file `example_dataset_description.yml` describes the class to label map. E.G.

```yaml
# DATASET DESCRIPTION FILE
#
# Here, we are describing our dataset. There are only a couple pieces
# of information that you have to supply. The first is the class names:
class_names: ["healthy", "ring", "schitzont", "troph"]
# Neural networks encode classes by integers, and the list above defines this
# ordering by index. I.e. "0" maps to "healthy", "1" maps to ring, e.t.c.
#
# You can define how the dataset is split up. This is the `dataset_split_fractions`
# definition below. It splits up the total dataset (all image-label pairs) by the
# percentages below. Each of these keys are required, and their values must sum
# to 1.
dataset_split_fractions:
  train: 0.7
  test:  0.25
  val:   0.05
# Finally, we have to actually point to our data. If we have just one set of
# folders for images and labels, then we just define the image path and label
# path, like below:
image_path: /path/to/images/
label_path: /path/to/labels/
# However, if we want multiple sets of folders for training and inference, we
# use `dataset_paths` to define the paths to folders individually.
dataset_paths:
  set1:  # this name is just for your convenience!
    image_path: /path/to/images/
    label_path: /path/to/labels/
  set2:
    image_path: /path/to/images/
    label_path: /path/to/labels/
  ...
```

Here is an example file structure for the each of the dataset paths in `example_dataset_description.yml` above.

    /path/to/images/
      image1.png
      image2.png
      ...
    /path/to/labels/
      image1.csv
      image2.csv
      ...

In the "labels" folder, each text file corresponds to one image file in "images", with the image extension replaced with "txt". Each label file should be a CSV (with or without a header) with the following columns in the following order:

  `class_index,x_center,y_center,width,height`

`class_index` is the 0-index of the class from the `class_names` field of `description.yaml`. `x_center` and `width` are normalized to the width of the image, and `y_center` and `height` are normalized to the height of the image.


### TODOs

- HEAVY data augmentation
- How does (Sx, Sy) affect performance? (Sx, Sy) vs. (anchor\_w, anchor\_h)?
- parameter sweeps?
- figure out PyTorch sync points
- BAG OF FREEBIESS
- turn `if __name__ ==  __main__` sanity checks into tests
- https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/tuning_guide.html

### Miscelaneous Notes

- Using the M1 chip's MPS accelerator seems to either
  - not converge, basically at all
  - error out with aa note requesting we report to PyTorch

### Sync Points
- IOU prediction
-
