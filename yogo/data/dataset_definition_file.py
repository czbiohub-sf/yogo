Specification
-----------------

Here are many examples: https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/lfm-dataset-definitions/


Required Fields
---------------

A dataset definition file is a YAML file with a `dataset_paths` key, with a list of dataset
path specifications as values. Dataset specifications are another key-value pair, where
the key is an arbitrary label for humans - it is not used by the parsing code. The value can
be either (a) `defn_path` which points to another definition file to be loaded (a "Recursive
Specification"), or (b) an `image_path` and a `label_path` pair (a "Literal Specification").
All paths are absolute. Here's an example

```yaml
# < other required fields >
dataset_paths:
    image_and_label_dirs:               # These three lines make up one Dataset Specification
        image_path: /path/to/images     # This Dataset Specification is a "Literal Specification"
        label_path: /path/to/labels     # since it defines the actual image and label paths
    another_dataset_defn:                                # These two lines make up another Dataset Specification.
        defn_path: /path/to/another/dataset_defn.yml     # This Dataset Specification is a "Recursive Specification".

# the composition of each of the Dataset Specifications above gives a full Dataset Definition.
```

Other Required Fields:

    - classes: a list of class names to be used in the dataset. Conflicting class definitions will be rejected.
    - split_fractions: a dictionary specifying the split fractions for the dataset. Keys can be
    `train`, `val`, and `test`. If `test_paths` is present, `train` should be left out. The values
    are floats between 0 and 1, and the sum of `split_fractions` should be 1. May be depricated!


Optional Fields
---------------

Optional fields include:
    - test_paths: similar to dataset_paths, but for the test set. Basically, it's just a way
    to explicitly specify which data is isolated for testing.
    - thumbnail_augmentation: a dictionary specifying a class name and pointing to a directory
    of thumbnails. Somewhat niche. Ideally we'd have some sort of other "arbitrary metadata"
    specification that could be used for this sort of thing.


Recursive Specifications
------------------------

They can be either relative or absolute. If they are relative, they're relative to the
parent directory of the definition file. So, if the definition file is in /path/to/defn_file.yml,
and was

```yaml
# < other required fields >
dataset_paths:
    in_this_dir:
        defn_path: dataset_defn.yml
    in_another_dir:
        defn_path: ../cool-data/dataset_defn.yml
```

then the folder structure would be

```console
$ tree /path
.
├── cool-data
│   └── defn_file.yml
└── to
    └── defn_file.yml

```

Note: the ability to specify another dataset definition within a dataset definition has some
restrictions. The dataset definition specifcation is a graph, where the nodes are Dataset
Definitions. Edges are directed, and are from the Definition to the Definitions that it defines.
For practical reasons, we can't accept arbitrary graph definitions. For example, if the
specification has a cycle, we will have to reject it (only trees are allowed). We'll also
choose to use unique paths - that is, for any Dataset Definition in our tree, there exists
only one path to it. This'll make it easier keep track of folders. Stricter == Better. Essentially,
we're defining a Tree ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory) ).
